# Slate
Network Engineering Lab Manager

This project is designed to facilitate testing in a networking lab environment - so far only from the simplistic viewpoints of resource inventory, resource scheduling, and IP address assignment management. 

## Roadmap

- Include virtual machines as workable entities.
- Give slate the ability to query its known devices for information about its layer 2/3 neighbours and build/update its "map" of the network that way.
- More to come.
